# NeoGebra
### NeoGebra is work in progress for now.
---
NeoGebra is a program that can be used for creating and verifying Non-Euclidean models. First, a model needs to be created by providing mathematical definitions for a line, point and probably others later on. You also need to provide the number of identifiers needed for each defintion, but this is not possible yet. Then you can see the model in action by creating lines and points by providing this number of identifiers and the correpsonding curve or point or whatever else you designed will be rendered. The model can then be mathematically checked to see if the postulates are valid. This will be added soon.
